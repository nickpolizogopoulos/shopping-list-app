# ShoppingListApp

A small application I made with just the very basics of Angular.
Let's see if I can make it better in some months of coding.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Instructions

Clone or download the repository to your local machine, cd in the folder and run npm install (you need node.js https://nodejs.org).

## To launch the application

Run ng serve and navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
